# About

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. I chose to write a simple structure for thinking about critical appraisal using some ideas I had previously developed.

I have kept the example bookdown content for the first section to remind me how to use the package

## Motivation 

I am writing this simple book for a few reasons:

1) To provide some content to practice using the bookdown package
2) Critical appraisal is often poorly taught at medical school (with some notable exceptions) and I hope this short book may provide a simple framework for students getting started with reading papers
3) Deciding what to believe is something thatis increasingly difficult these days. I think learning to appraise scientific studies is a good place to start for deciding what to believe / how to assess causality in the world around us 

## Who is this for?

- undergraduate medical students without prior training, experience or confidence in assessing the value of scientific papers
- anyone with an interest in health and medicine who wants a framework for deciding whether or not to believe the latest study or health hack being spouted on the internet
